December, 1990 – V.Ardzinba, the leader of “Soyuz” faction was elected as a chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Abkhazian ASSR, who was well known for his anti-Georgian position. May 26, 1991 after Georgia’s declaration of restoration its independence, Russia continues its destructing policy in Abkhazia for creating tensed and ‘explosive’ situation in this Georgian region. Such policy was aimed for maintaining Russian influence in Georgia. In spite of the fact that the ethnic Abkhaz population consisted only 17% and Georgians – 46%, the later were merely represented in Abkhazian Governmental structures. October, 1991 – the 65 mandates of the Deputies of the Abkhazian Supreme Soviet were distributed as like: 28 – ethnic Abkhazs (separatists, mainly under Kremlin policy influence); 26-Georgians and 11- representatives of other nationalities.

        "first": "In the early 1990s, the Russian Federation used the strategy prepared during the Soviet regime. The main methodology of which was to inspire and stir up ethnic strife in the autonomies established by the Soviet government in Georgia, as well as to form a local separatist elite. The OSCE Mission to Georgia started working in the Tskhinvali region / South Ossetia in late 1992. As a result of the conflict, up to a thousand people were killed and up to a hundred people were missing. About 70-80 thousand people were evicted from their homes. The region was virtually empty. As of today, the population of the Tskhinvali region / South Ossetia is 15-20 thousand. This time, Russia managed to play the role of “mediator” and “peacemaker” in the conflict it caused. On June 24, 1992, under the Russian (Sochi) Treaty, a joint peacekeeping force (consisting of Russians, Georgians, and Ossetians) was deployed in the region and a Joint Control Commission was established. Prior to the Russian-Georgian war in August 2008, the Georgian government established control over a significant part of the Tskhinvali region / South Ossetia. As well as the functioning peacekeeping format, which provided economic and infrastructural rehabilitation to the region with the assistance of the international community (EU, OSCE). During this period, the Georgian government developed a number of peace initiatives, including the granting of broad autonomous status to the Tskhinvali region / South Ossetia, the redistribution of power, economic development, and international security guarantees, but Russia effectively thwarted all peace plans. At the same time, the Russian Federation was illegally granting Russian passports to the population of the Tskhinvali region / South Ossetia, which was confirmed by a report prepared by an independent international fact-finding mission (the so-called Tagliavini Commission), intensifying the military militarization process and increasing violence.",
        "second": "Finally, the pre-existing “frozen conflict” was replaced by full-scale military aggression and occupation by the Russian Federation in August 2008 in the Tskhinvali region / South Ossetia, with Russia opening its second front in Abkhazia as well. As a result of the war, about fifty Georgian villages in the Tskhinvali region / South Ossetia and surrounding areas were burned and completely destroyed. In these areas, including the Akhalgori district, the central government of Georgia has lost control. Up to 130,000 people, mostly ethnic Georgians were evicted from their homes and subjected to ethnic cleansing. 26 thousand of them, residents of the Tskhinvali region / South Ossetia and surrounding areas are still in exile. According to current data, the number of IDPs and refugees from the Tskhinvali region / South Ossetia and Abkhazia exceeds 300,000. The international community has strongly condemned the ethnic cleansing of the Georgian population in the Tskhinvali region / South Ossetia, as evidenced by resolutions of the European Parliament in 2011, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in 2008-2009, and the NATO Parliamentary Assembly in 2010, as well as numerous reports from authoritative international organizations. The military intervention was carried out by the Russian Federation, on August 26, 2008, by so-called South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Recognition of “independence” followed, which further complicated the peace process. After the Russo-Georgia war in August 2008, an “Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on the Conflict in Georgia” (the so-called Tagliavini Commission) was set up with the support of the European Union. The mission presented a report in September 2009 detailing the conflict chronology, assessments, and other materials related to the conflict.",
        "third": "Currently, the Tskhinvali region / South Ossetia is completely isolated from the outside world. Barbed wire, fences, and other barriers are being erected by the Russian military, including buildings directly built on the land belonging to the population. Such a process significantly hinders and in some cases makes it impossible to move freely, to receive first aid, to receive education in the native language, to work on agricultural plots, to have access to drinking and irrigation systems, to enter cemeteries, and to enjoy other civil and economic rights, and the Cases of arrest on charges of “illegal border crossing” are very common. All of the above exacerbates the dire humanitarian situation for both Georgian and Ossetian populations living on both sides of the dividing line. SUPPORT US"

        "text": "On July 24th, 1783, a “Friendship Agreement” known as the Treaty of Georgievsk was signed between the Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti and the Russian Empire. According to which the Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti came under the protection of the Russian Empire. Under the terms of the treaty, the Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti refused to pursue an independent foreign policy, while Russia promised military assistance. At the same time, Kartli-Kakheti maintained the status of a kingdom. It was ruled by a Georgian king, who had to be approved by the Russian imperial court. The terms of this treaty were repeatedly violated by the Russian Empire. In particular, they did not fulfill their promise and regularly left the Georgian kings face to face with the enemy. However, in 1801 they completely ignored the existence of the treaty and established a total Russian rule over the Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti. On September 12, 1801, the Russian Emperor Alexander I issued an order declaring the Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti abolished and annexing it to the Russian Empire. The order became known to the Georgian public only on April 12 of the same year, when the representatives of the nobility gathered at the Zion Cathedral, which was besieged by the Russian army in Tbilisi, and stated the orders. Of course, such one-sided violence was met with great protest from the Georgian society. However, neither the nobility nor the commonality found enou",

        "text": "After the February Revolution of 1917, Russia was governed by an interim government. By the decision of the Provisional Government, the management of the Transcaucasus was entrusted to a special committee of the Transcaucasus – Ozakom. However, Ozakom lost power after the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia in October 1917 and the overthrowing of the interim government. On November 15, 1917, Ozakom took over the functions of a new body of the regional government – The Transcaucasian Commissariat. With the establishment of the Commissariat, Transcaucasia officially separated from Soviet Russia. For its part, the Transcaucasian Commissariat convened the Transcaucasian Seim, which was a representative body of the Transcaucasian countries and was headed by Nikoloz Chkheidze. It was the Transcaucasian Seim that decided on April 22, 1918, announcing the creation of the Transcaucasian Democratic Federal Republic. It was an attempt to unite the three states, Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan, led by Akaki Chkhenkeli. Unfortunately, for a number of internal and foreign political reasons, the federation was unable to perform its functions, and on May 26, 1918, the Transcaucasian Seim declared its self-liquidation and, with it, the liquidation of the Democratic Federal Republic. On the same day, at 4:50 a.m. on May 26, 1918, a sitting of the Georgian National Council chaired by Noe Jordania opened at the former Palace of the Caucasus Crown Prince in Tbilisi. He addressed the audience, after which he read the “Act of Independence of Georgia.” From that moment on, Georgia declared its independence and plan to take its place in the Commonwealth of Independent States as a full-fledged, sovereign democratic republic.",

        "text": "The Democratic Republic of Georgia faced very difficult challenges during the years of independence. In addition to domestic problems, it was constantly engaged in combat operations on various fronts and repelling several attacks. However, 1921 proved to be crucial for the Republic. There has been a civil war in Russia since 1917, which did not allow it to wage wars of conquest. However, as soon as the situation stabilized slightly, Russia immediately began to rebuild the borders of the Russian Empire, and part of this plan was the conquest of the Caucasus. In April 1920, the Russian army occupied Azerbaijan. In May Russia invaded the borders of the Democratic Republic of Georgia. The attack was repelled, and on May 7, 1920, a peace treaty was signed between Russia and Georgia. According to the agreement, Soviet Russia recognized Georgia’s independence. Later, in November 1929, the Russian army invaded Armenia, which further complicated the situation in Georgia. Russia launched a decisive attack in February 1921. According to the plan, in Georgia, in Borchaly Uyezd, the so-called “Uprising” was launched. To help this uprising, the 11th Red Army of Soviet Russia invaded the territory of Georgia. The hostilities began on 12 February. To provide a legal justification for the intervention, a telegram was sent to Moscow by the Georgian Revolutionary Committee (Revkom) asking for help. Paradoxically, this request was sent on February 16, when units of the Russian army were already in Georgia. Despite the unequal forces, the battles were fought with a transient advantage. Complicating matters for Georgia was the fact that various Russian military units were approaching the capital from the south, as well as from Abkhazia and the Dariali gorge. This circumstance made the issue of protecting the capital very difficult. On February 20-21, a large clash took place in Kojori district, which was repulsed by the Georgian Army and the People’s Guard. However, on February 24, the leadership of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Georgia decided to retreat in the direction of Mtskheta, and on February 25, the Russian Red Army entered Tbilisi. Despite the defeat, the government of the Republic of Georgia managed to leave the country on March 17, 1921, without agreeing to surrender to Soviet Russia. A delegation headed by Grigol Lortkipanidze remained in Georgia to negotiate a ceasefire. As a result of the work of this delegation, an agreement on the cessation of hostilities was signed on March 17-18, 1921. Russia has finally conquered Georgia.",

        "text": "The second half of the 1980s was quite turbulent for the Soviet Union. On the one hand, changes were inevitable, and on the other hand, the central government did not have sufficient legitimacy to implement these changes. Various initiatives of the central government were met with protests by the population of the Union Republics due to the existence of strong national and anti-Soviet movements in these republics. Georgia was no exception. The situation in Georgia became extremely tense in April 1989, which was preceded by the so-called uprising in Abkhazia on March 18 of the same year. Likhni Assembly, to which Likhni’s appeal was received, meant the withdrawal of the Abkhaz ASSR from Georgia. Georgian citizens responded to this appeal with a multi-thousand protest rally on March 25. One of the organizers of this rally was the prominent leader of the National Forces Merab Kostava. From April 4, 1989, the wave of protests shifted to Tbilisi and the focus changed. Along with the issue of Abkhazia, the rally became sharply anti-Soviet in nature, with protesters demanding the restoration of Georgia’s independence The Soviet authorities decided to take decisive action, and the Politburo decided to move regular and internal troops to Tbilisi. The operation to disperse the rally was led by the commander of the Transcaucasian Military District, Colonel-General Igor Rodionov, and Konstantin Kochetov. Although the protesters had notice of its decision to disperse, they refused to disperse. The operation to disperse the rally began on April 9, at 4 p.m. The protesters were under siege. Armored vehicles were moving in front of the punitive detachment, but the dispersion was carried out by special forces armed with batons and shovels. Poison gas was also used during the dispersion of the protest. 19 people died after the raid, 16 of whom were women. More than 2,000 people were poisoned by gas. The tragedy of April 9 turned out to be crucial for the consolidation of the Georgian nation. After the tragedy, the Soviet authorities were unable to rehabilitate it and its fate was decided. One year later, on October 28, 1990, the Supreme Council “Round Table – Free Georgia” led by Zviad Gamsakhurdia won a majority of votes (54%) in the Supreme Council elections. On November 14, the council elected Zviad Gamsakhurdia as a chairman at the first session. Another year later, on March 31, 1991, a referendum was held throughout Georgia to restore Georgia’s independence. The majority of the population supported the restoration of independence for the country, on the basis of which, on April 9, 1991, at 12:30 pm, the Supreme Council of Georgia adopted the Act on the Restoration of State Independence of Georgia.",
